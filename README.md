### üêç Contribution Snake (dynamic)

Add a dynamic "contribution snake" to your profile to create a playful, eye-catching animation across your contribution grid. Below are the steps and a ready-to-use GitHub Actions workflow that generates `output/snake.svg` automatically.

**1) Add this `<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/malik8154/malik8154/output/snake.svg" alt="contribution-snake" />` to your README where you want the snake to appear:**

```html
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/malik8154/malik8154/output/snake.svg" alt="contribution-snake" />
```

**2) Create the GitHub Actions workflow file** at `.github/workflows/snake.yml` in your repo with the following content:

```yaml
name: Generate contribution snake
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * *' # daily
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Generate contribution snake
        uses: platane/commit-snake-action@v1
        with:
          output: output/snake.svg

      - name: Commit and push
        uses: stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action@v4
        with:
          commit_message: Update contribution snake
          branch: main
```

> Notes:
>
> * The action `platane/commit-snake-action` draws the snake image based on your contributions. If you prefer another snake style, you can swap the action or customize parameters as described in that action's README.
> * Make sure your default branch is `main` or adjust the workflow accordingly.
